# Homework 2 - Steam Reviews 2021
The proposed *IPython Notebook* contains a lot of scripts for a complete analysis of the *Steam Reviews Dataset*
### Team members
For this Homework, the members of *Team 12*, are:

* Matteo Di Mauro
* Paolo Falcone
* Davide Mascolo
### Contents
Our repo only contains the *Main Notebook*, without any other Python file to import inside it, because we managed to create a pretty clean notebook. 

The dataset was uploaded directly from a Google Drive folder, so each member of the group could work at it without any problem.
## IPython Notebook 
Inside the notebook we wrote the *[RQs]*' scripts as best we could. The result is very clean, and most important, very clear. Each *[RQ]* is adequately commented.
